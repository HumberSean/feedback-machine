Good job with testing values. 

Your test and function do not fulfill the functional specifications. See requirement #5.  For, "Way off!", look at your assertion and compare it to your input value.

Your test and function do not fulfill the functional specifications. See requirement #2 (1-10 inclusive), and #5.

For test to pass, for this application we should test 4 (as you did) and another valid number in the middle of the range that is not the secret number so that we get the "Guess again" result.

Good job with testing values. 
Your test and function do not fulfill the functional specifications. See requirement #5.  You copied your test values from the function and not the specification. Our tests need to enforce the specification, not duplicate the function.

Boundary testing for this context needs 0,1,2  9,10,11.  These are the numbers that are the boundary, just outside, and just inside.

In your comments for the parts you fixed in the function, it is always a good idea to justify or explain your changes: "... to match the provided specification."

Don't forget to add comments to the file where you made changes (and why you made them).
