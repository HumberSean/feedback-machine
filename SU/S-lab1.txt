FEEDBACK
Good job!
We will be using this lab in later classes so it is worthwhile to take the time and perfect it. You will have fewer issues later.
See rubric for more feedback.
PART 1
Use BEM for ids and name attributes: login__user login__pass
Missing the heading.
Does not follow BEM. Elements need 2 underscores: output__text
Output value should be in its own span. Notice label is plain but value is bold.
fieldset and legend go inside form element.
PART 2
I was expecting the fields to turn red (see my CSS rule). We should not rely on the HTML validators.
This does not pass jslint.com
#6 Required to add focus to error field.
EXTRA CHALLENGE
Nice job!
Nice job adding the class!
