var item1=["PROPERTIES", "Not all of these properties are meaningful to this object in a web application context (#3).", "Does not have four properties and a method.", "The HTML file has not been updated to reflect your custom object.", "The HTML file has not been updated as required in the HTML file, you overwrote the default text. Please pay careful attention to all requirements."];
var item2=["METHOD", "The method does not update a property of the object.", "Your method (function) does not update the object, it only outputs the property values (#4).", "Your method should accept a parameter, rather than using a hard-coded value...", "The output (alert) is required to be in the function (# 4)."];

Please pay careful attention to requirements.", "Nice check for validation before changing the object!"];

Nice work!", "The default text should appear as the second parameter to the prompt (see Stretch Goal requirements).", "No need to separate extra challenge code, just give me the final version. Thank you!", "For the stretch goal, the prompt default text needs to be current values from object properties."];

I encourage you to do this first (&quot;pseudocode&quot;) before you start your work.", "Missing responses to professional practice questions. Please respond to them in future assignments.", "Please email me if you are having trouble with this. We can make time to get you caught up. Understanding objects is critical in JavaScript."];
