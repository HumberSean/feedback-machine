//JavaScript Assignment 2 - Lucky 7 Movies Array

var feedBack = [];

var item0=["FEEDBACK", "Great job!", "Good job. See rubric for more feedback.", "Put all JavaScript in the required external file (#1).", "You renamed your js file so I had to rename it back to match the HTML. Be sure to confirm your file submission in the folder before submitting.", "Remove the / before the filename in your HTML file. I should be able to click on the HTML file and have it open in my browser."];
var item1=["VARIABLES", "Create 7 variables for your movies (#2).", "Giving your variables more neutral names will make them future-proof. E.g. movie1, movie2..."];
var item2=["ARRAY", "Use your variables in your array. No need to repeat the strings again. That's what the variables are for (#3)."];
var item3=["RESULT MESSAGE", "Use your user input variable as the index to access your array... var movieChoice = myMovies[userInput - 1];", "Does not handle cancel (null).", "Does not handle 0.", "Popup should only show selected movie (#7).", "Movie number is off by one.", "Does not handle the default text from the prompt.", "Missing invalid input message (#9)."];
var item4=["CONSOLE OUTPUT", "The output to the console should have been a loop, since this lab was about arrays and loops. A for loop would be the correct loop to output from an array.", "Movie numbers in console output should start at 1, not 0.", "Message should include &quot;Movie&quot; and # in output text (#8).", "Starting your loop at 1 misses the first item in the array [0]", "Console output missing (#8)."];
var item5=["STRETCH GOAL", "And the extra challenge too! Nice work!", "You need a variable to hold the prompt value inside your while statement. Use this to end your while loop.", "Try to create “self-commenting” code with explanatory variable names: while( validInput === false )", "Be explicit in your while statement: while( inputValue === true )", "Avoid while(true) and try to create “self-commenting” code with explanatory variable names: while( validInput === false )", "No need to check for true after the while loop. Logically, we can't get there until that condition is reached by the while loop.", "You need a while loop for this, not a for loop."];
var item6=["PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE", "Add helpful comments to mark the sections of your code and significant logic pieces. I encourage you to do this first (“pseudocode”) before you start your work.", "Your loop should have a comment above it describing what it does, as well as comments for significant blocks inside the loop.", "Missing responses to professional practice questions. Please respond to them in future assignments.", "Please email me if you are having trouble with this. We can make time to get you caught up. Each week will build on the previous week, so do not let yourself fall behind."];
