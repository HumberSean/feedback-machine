//====== RESULTS
Hello Ragini,

Thank you for meeting with me today to discuss the issue of academic misconduct regarding the Assignment 5 in Front-End Web Development.  

In our meeting you acknowledged:
-Your code wasn't working and you took help from a friend.

Accordingly, it will be a grade of zero for this assessment. Any future incidents of plagiarism in any of our courses will result in a zero for the course and I will recommend expulsion from the program.

I will reiterate my insistence that you do your own work and do not: share code, show code, share computers, work together, or discuss assignments.

We are all here to help and to support your success in the program - and as a web developer - so do not hesitate to reach out to your instructors for help, we love to help.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to email me or set up a meeting.

Sean


SUBJECT:
Academic Misconduct Follow-up

Hello Jinal,

Thank you for meeting with me yesterday to discuss the issue of academic misconduct regarding the Express API Assignment in Full-Stack Web Development.  

In our meeting you acknowledged:
-The similarities between your design and code and that of another student.
-You used Joanna's demo code (Week 6 lesson) and your own code from a previous lab.
-You discussed and searched for your portfolio design with another student.
-You said that you created your own code and that the similarities were due to Bootstrap, the demo code and the auto-formatter of your IDE.

In reviewing the submissions and the meeting notes, there are too many similarities in the submissions to be coincidence and not enough unique contributions to the submission. Accordingly, it will be a grade of zero for these assessments. Any future incidents of plagiarism in any of our courses will result in a zero for the course and I will recommend expulsion from the program.

I will reiterate my insistence that you do your own work and do not: share code, show code, share computers, work together, or discuss assignments.

We are all here to help and to support your success in the program - and as a web developer - so do not hesitate to reach out to your instructors for help, we love to help.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to email me or set up a meeting.

//====== RESULTS - ZERO FOR COURSE
SUBJECT:
Academic Misconduct Determination


Hello Saahil,

Thank you for meeting with me on Tuesday to discuss the issue of academic misconduct regarding the Figma Assignment in Web Design (HTTP 5121).  

In that meeting you acknowledged:
-Arun was having difficulty working with Figma
-You shared your Figma file with Arun

In our last meeting on March 5 regarding plagiarism in the Front-End Development Lab 4, you assured me that the sharing of files would not happen again. In our discussion (and the follow-up email) you were warned that the outcome for any future incident in any other course would be a final grade of zero for that course. Accordingly, this incident will mean a final grade of zero for the Web Design course.

While outcomes such as this are not what either of us had wished for, they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the Web Development program. However, I wish you the best for your future endeavours.

Best regards,

Sean Doyle

Assignment 5 Misconduct Meeting
Hi Emmanuel,

Link sent for online meeting today at 3:15.

Thank you.



While working on the assignment, I was stuck on the alt attribute for images. In my effort to find a solution, I resorted to searching online . 


//USE OF GENAI
Hi Chait,

Thank you, I greatly appreciate your honesty.

While the use of GenAI as a coding helper will be expected of you in the industry, in our academic setting, its use is prohibited except where explicitly allowed by your instructor for a specific assessment. This is so that we can evaluate your work and your ability to deliver the learning objectives. A strong understanding of code is required to work with GenAI in order to assess its results, and the learning objectives we have set for you will lead you to that strong understanding. Similarly, the key skill of a web developer is not "coding", but problem solving. If you use a tool to solve your problems for you, you will not develop the problem solving skills that are so crucial to professional web development.

Any future unauthorized use of AI in your course work may result in expulsion from the program, and having plagiarism on your Humber student record.

If you have any questions or confusions about the use of AI as a student, please email me and we will clear up any outstanding issues.

Thank you.
