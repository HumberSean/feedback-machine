var item2=["USERS", "Find specific terms beyond 'user' and 'admin'. Think of creating a Class or a database table, what term would you use?", "Missing a role:"];
var item3=["FEATURES", "Missing Must Have:", "Missing Should Have:", "Missing Nice to Haves. What future features would make your app stand out from others?"];
var item4=["TECH STACK", "Be sure to thoroughly research your APIs - what the cost and limits are. Each year at least one project gets blown up due to insufficient API research.", "Consider going with technology you are confident with rather than using this opportunity for experimentation. You can always rebuild with new tech once this is launched and working."];
