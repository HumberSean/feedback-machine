Thank you!", "Please put all submission files in one folder to zip and submit.", "Please email me (or book a meeting) if you would like to go through this and have a strong foundation for the rest of the project."];
var item1=["FILE NAMES", "Image files should be in lowercase with no spaces.", "All file names should be in lowercase with no spaces or special characters."];
var item2=["IMAGES FOLDER", "You have added the folder, but not updated the src attributes to include the folder, which means your images aren't showing up."];
var item3=["SITE NAVIGATION", "The top of every page should look the same on every page, with all menu items.", "Don't use target =&quot;_blank&quot; for internal site links. This opens up the page in a new tab. Use only for external links."];
var item4=["LINKED LOGO", "Logo should be in top left corner."];
var item5=["COMMENTING", "Use comments to mark the sections of your HTML file. This makes editing and maintenance easier."];

var item7=["STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS", "Missing a header element. This will hold the main title and logo and the navigation.", "Missing a footer element. This will have copyright info, extra nav if required, and social links."];
var item8=["VALID MARKUP", "By 'trailing slash' it means elements that don't have a closing tag (meta, img), they shouldn't have a / at the closing &gt;.", "Use the W3C Validator to catch your errors. Fix these before starting Stage 2. Email me if any error message doesn't make sense."];
